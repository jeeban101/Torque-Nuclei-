# Torque(Nuclei)

## Introduction

In the contemporary era, we rely fully on the internet to accomplish our daily operations. The utilization of digital communication media for data and information exchange is expanding in line with the rise of the internet. The main issue in the field of networking is data security due to hackers. Data security (user credentials) is becoming a huge concern and a critical challenge as the volume of data communicated over the internet grows. So, after looking into and investigating all of the issues, this "GUI-based advanced and secure password manager and data security tool based on the LSB steganography technique with a three-layer encryption-decryption algorithm" will be useful for individuals, small and large organizations, and with the help of this tool, software-based attacks and data theft can be prevented, and passwords will be more secured. Moreover, the global internet penetration rate is rapidly increasing, which is leading to an increase in cyber-attacks and data theft.

## Aim

The main aim of the project is focused on creating a "GUI-based advanced and secured password manager and data security tool based on the LSB steganography technique" which will be useful in data-oriented organizations, and the uses of this tool in those industries or enterprise include verifying unique or duplicate records, monitoring the integrity of the system or file, generating and storing user credentials (passwords) in the local system, cloud, or in a database using high-level encryption/keys and automatically hiding those encrypted passwords, confidential documents, or information in images and audio (LSB steganography technique) for protection from hackers, or acting as a backup during a disaster or data breach.

This project is mainly targeted to aid data and password security of business-oriented organizations. Moreover, this project is mostly targeted at the business sector (main end user), which is willing to protect their password, confidential data as well as user credentials in a secure manner. Additionally, this project not only manages and protects user passwords but can also be used by those organizations to keep trade secrets, private data, ideas about new inventions, and chemical formulas hidden.
